# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 2, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Finished the binary algorith app in JavaScript.  Started to build my portolio website.  Coded for 3 hours :)

**Thoughts:** There is still one function that I am having difficulty with.

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on my portfolio website.  Have to figure out how to incorporate google photos into the page.  It isn't working for some reason.

**Thoughts:**  I'm slowly but surely getting better
